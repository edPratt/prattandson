        Insulated vinyl siding is top choice in New England homes and
        business. Vinyl siding looks great, and its insulating qualities
        reduce energy consumption. This means you are warmer in the
        winter, cooler in the summer and pay lower energy bills.

        What People are Saying...
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        "Thank you and your staff for the magnificent job that your company
        just completed at our home in Newton. This is the third job that
        you’ve done for our family and each one is a ‘work of art.’ Your
        company is truly a joy to do business with! Keep up the fine work!"
        <footer>&mdash; Clair, Newton</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "I observed your work in my neighborhood and was impressed. Your work
        crew was exceptional. They were hard-working craftsmen and very
        real gentlemen."
        <footer>&mdash; Christine, West Roxbury</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "My wife and I would like to extend our gratitude for an excellent
        vinyl siding and roofing job recently performed on our home. The work
        crews assigned to both projects were more than professional and
        appeared to take an enormous pride in their work.  As a result,
        our home is now by far the nicest on the street if not the entire
        subdivision. No other siding or roofing job even comes close to the
        one performed on our home by Pratt and Son.
