        <h3>How We Operate</h3>
        <p>
        An average-size roof is stripped, installed, and totally cleaned up in one day to protect your home from the elements and minimize your inconvenience. We use the highest quality materials and all of our workers are trained certified installers using the strictest guidelines set forth by our manufacturers’ standards and our own quality controls. Each home is prepped and protected prior to stripping. And the grounds are thoroughly cleaned with a magnetic nail sweeper.
